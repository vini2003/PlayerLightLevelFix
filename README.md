# playerlightlevelfix
Have you ever had an idea so bad it turned out to be good?

That was me, half an hour ago.

### Why?
Because someone asked for it, and I was bored.

### How?
playerlightlevelfix was written with [Fabric](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader/), and sadly not enough caffeine.

### License?
Not `:arr:`!
playerlightlevelfix is released under [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), because whenever possible, software should be made available to others.

### Style? Guidelines?
You guys have standards?
